Here’s a concise, point-wise breakdown of why Appium 2.0 uses the WebDriver Protocol (W3C WebDriver):
 
✅ Standardization: W3C WebDriver is an official web standard, ensuring compatibility.
✅ Improved Stability & Performance: Reduces unnecessary protocol conversions, making automation faster.
✅ Better Mobile Automation Support: Works well with UIAutomator2, Espresso (Android), and XCUITest (iOS).
✅ JSON Wire Protocol had limitations, requiring extra translation between Selenium/Appium commands and browser actions.
✅ Future-Proofing Automation: Ensures long-term support as Selenium and Appium move to W3C WebDriver.
✅ Simplified Command Structure: W3C WebDriver uses a cleaner, more efficient request format.
